1- While importing the github repo I had an issue with replit not recognizing the project as public project, I fixed it by changing the privacy settings to public.

2- Initial plan created with Perplexity AI was not focused on rapid prototyping, it was more focused on creating a complete project manager app with React + Vite + TypeScript in Replit. So I  had to modify the set up prompt to focus on rapid prototyping.

            Create a complete project manager app with React + Vite + TypeScript in Replit.

            PROJECT STRUCTURE:
            - React 18 + Vite + TypeScript
