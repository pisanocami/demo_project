1-Create plan with perplexity AI - Im going to use lab mode

    "Create a comprehensive development plan for a simple project manager app using React Vite frontend and FastAPI backend, hosted on Replit. The output should be a .zip with every document needed to build the project and track progress.

    Please provide:
    1. Project structure and setup instructions for Replit
    2. Complete project documentation outline
    3. Frontend components list (to be built with Lovable)
    4. API endpoints specification with request/response examples
    5. Step-by-step development workflow

    The frontend should be built exclusively with Replit focusing on components and UI, while preparing documented endpoint placeholders. Then backend API implementation will follow with Cursor."


2-Save plan as .md on a new directory


3-Create Github Repo with project

https://github.com/pisanocami/demo_project

(Now im going to read the generated documentation :) )

Initial prompt for replit is ready, Im gonna run it on Replit

4-Open repo as a new project on Replit

5-Run initial prompt on Replit

App is ready but I need to debug some errors
